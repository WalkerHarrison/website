Hello! My name is Walker Harrison and I'm a data scientist. 

I graduated from Columbia University in 2014 with a double major in mathematics and creative writing. After working in marketing and business development roles for several years at IBM and The Practical Dev, I got my Master's degree in statistics from Duke University. Since 2018 I have been working as a quantitative analyst for the New York Yankees.

This website will be used primarily to publish blogposts that explore some of the ways statistics intersect with our everyday lives. Each post will include the R code I used to execute the analysis, along with some written thoughts. I intend to make these blogposts accessible to a non-technical audience as well as anyone who happens to know R and might want to reproduce some of the results.

If you find any of the posts interesting, feel free to comment on them or reach out to me via the various social media linked to the left.

Thanks!
