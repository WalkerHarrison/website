<p>Many moons ago, when people actually physically went to work everyday, I had a pretty lengthy commute by New York City standards. There are a handful of ways to get from Park Slope, Brooklyn to my office in Yankee Stadium, but I chose to take the 2/3 train from Grand Army Plaza and then transfer to the 4 train at Nevins Street for the remainder of the trip, typically clocking in at around an hour in travel time.</p>
<p>At some point though I started simply walking the first leg from my home to the Nevins Street station. That seems a little crazy, since I was substituting a few stops on the 2/3 for a mile-long march, but I enjoyed the exercise â€” and I also felt a little more relaxed once I got on the 4-train after my stroll.</p>
<p>Why did I find peace by walking the first ___. Perhaps the exercise-induced endorphins were rushing through me as I sat on the 4-train. But I also wonder if I had accidentally decreased the variance in my commute time and with it some of the stress I feel wondering how long the my trip will take.</p>
